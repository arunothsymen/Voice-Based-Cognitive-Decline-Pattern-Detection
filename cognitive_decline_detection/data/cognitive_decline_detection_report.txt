===== VOICE-BASED COGNITIVE DECLINE PATTERN DETECTION - FINAL REPORT =====

## Overview
Analyzed 10 voice samples for potential cognitive decline indicators.
Found 2 samples with significant deviations from normal patterns.

## Most Insightful Features
1. filler_count (correlation with risk: 0.74)
2. mfcc9_std (correlation with risk: 0.70)
3. mfcc13_std (correlation with risk: 0.68)
4. mfcc5_std (correlation with risk: 0.67)
5. repetition_count (correlation with risk: 0.66)

## ML Methods Used
1. Feature Selection: Variance and correlation filtering to identify most relevant features
2. Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest to identify outlier speech patterns
3. Clustering: K-means to group similar speech patterns
4. Dimensionality Reduction: PCA for visualization and noise reduction

## Risk Assessment Summary
High risk: 1 samples
Moderate risk: 5 samples
Low risk: 4 samples

## Potential Next Steps
1. Validate findings with clinical data from patients with confirmed cognitive conditions
2. Add more cognitive-specific tasks (e.g., word recall, sentence completion)
3. Implement longitudinal tracking to detect changes over time
4. Integrate with other biomarkers for a more comprehensive assessment
5. Apply transfer learning using pre-trained speech models for better feature extraction

## Conclusion
This proof-of-concept pipeline demonstrates the potential of voice analysis
for detecting cognitive decline patterns. The combination of acoustic and
linguistic features provides a non-invasive way to identify potential warning signs.
Further clinical validation is needed for deployment in real-world scenarios.
